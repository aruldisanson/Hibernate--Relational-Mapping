I have completed Hibernate training at JSpiders, where I gained both theoretical knowledge and practical hands-on experience. I learned how Hibernate works internally, including the concepts of ORM, persistence context, EntityManager, sessions, transactions, and mapping relationships. I also practiced using Hibernate tools and configurations such as EntityManagerFactory, HQL/JPQL, annotations, and different mapping strategies (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, Many-to-Many). Through real-time coding exercises, I built CRUD operations, implemented mappings between entities, and understood how Hibernate simplifies database interaction. Overall, this training greatly improved my understanding of Hibernate and strengthened my ability to develop efficient and maintainable Java applications.
